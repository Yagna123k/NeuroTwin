## 💡 What Is NeuroTwin?

> NeuroTwin is not just an AI assistant. It's *you* — multiplied.

We’re building a full-stack **mirror of your mind**. NeuroTwin listens, learns, and evolves from your digital footprint — emails, chats, meetings, code, content. It becomes your second self: one that splits into intelligent **mini-you’s** for every role you play in life.

Each “you” can act independently — or in sync — across voice, text, and web.

This isn’t ChatGPT.
This is your **conscious computing layer**.

---

## 🚀 Why It Matters

Modern life is too much for one brain.

We juggle roles: founder, creator, friend, student, thinker, performer. NeuroTwin is built for this new age of multi-minded living — where the most powerful asset is a **digitally cloned, role-aware, autonomous version of you**.

It’s not about replacing you.
It’s about **scaling you**.
